description: |
  explore the space of discrete space-times in Einstein gravity applying a
  Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, through the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm

  the considered space is made by Triangulations, suitable to approximate a
  generic space-time with a finite length scale (lattice spacing), with a
  time-sliced structure (so they are called Causal)
original: |
  in this project a 2D simulation has been implemented, with an original
  algorithm for gauge fields introduction (a U(1) gauge field is implemented,
  the algorithm is directly generalizable to SU(2) and U(N))
